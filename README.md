# USING PYGAME-CE
This could be an introduction to the famous Pong Game
There is a bouncing ball and a movable rect
What is left to do is had another rect that is IA driven, add collisions and VOILA, basic pong
Of course we could had a main menu, keeping track of scores, and make the IA faster each time we get over 5 points
At the moment you can move the rect using ZQSD (yes, i am french :D)
