### USING PYGAME-CE
This could be an introduction to the famous Pong Game

There is a bouncing ball and a movable rect

What is left to do is had another rect that is IA driven, add collisions and VOILA, basic pong

Of course we could had a main menu, keeping track of scores, and make the IA faster each time we get over 5 points

At the moment you can move the rect using ZQSD (yes, i am french :D)
